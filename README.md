## About TODO LIST

â€‹TODO LIST is a web application framework created with Laravel framework and with Admin Lte that makes it simple and elegant. I published it on github as a public project, the intention is that other developers who have any difficulties or even want to take advantage of the project, can do so.
I already make it clear that, with absolute certainty, there are many points to improve and others that can even be changed with better techniques.
Here are some features already implemented:

- Multiple language
- Web and api version
- Web with basic authentication
- Api with sanctum authentication
- Sqlite database
- PHP unit
- Admin Lte for the frontend

## Attention Points

Implemented middleware that allows a task to be updated or deleted only by the user who created it. (Can also be done with Policy)

## To change the project(brand) name, follow the steps below

- Open the .env file in the project root, and change the line **_APP_NAME=TODO_LIST_**  to  **_APP_NAME=YOUR_NAME_**
